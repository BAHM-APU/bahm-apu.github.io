                <div class="">
                    <h4> Connor's Testimony </h4>
                    <p> I was told of a woman who was at one of our footwashings and experienced so much healing and freedom that she called a man in her family who had sexually assaulted her as a kid and forgave him.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="">
                    <h4> Ryan's Testimony </h4>
                    <p> A few weeks ago, Nick Mirabella and I were being interviewed for his friend’s school project. A few days later, we found out that his friend’s partner wasn’t a Christian beforehand, however, because of the way we loved on her during the interview and because of the mission and heart behind BAHM, she subsequently decided she wanted to give her life to the Lord. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="">
                    <h4> Sarah's Testimony </h4>
                    <p> At the foot-washing event, the basin, I came with full faith and expectation with what God was going to do for the women on our campus. I was beyond excited to support, but had no sense of belief for what God could do in me. After a really special time of praying with some incredible women of God, it was around 8/8:30 and I knew that God had told me He wanted me to get my feet washed. I looked over and the station that God highlighted to me was closing down. Let me just say, God is really SO intricate and specific about the way He heals, even to the slightest detail. Intricate detail #1 I had taken my shoes off earlier to clean them and let them be nice and aired out because I always try to be as burden-less as possible for men. God told me to put them back on and my act of walking to the station with my shoes broke that fear. Intricate detail #2 I HATE asking men for things (hence the burden thing) and because the station was closing down, I had to actually go over there and ask “hey guys, can you wash my feet?”. It took everything in me to do that, but it was powerful to ask for something and not be rejected. Intricate detail #3 God highlighted one station very specifically. It was the only station that had two white men. Great. I thought to myself. There definitely a deeper layer of hurt there.  </p>
                    <p> All of the details came to life as my friends dragged me and I reluctantly went to the station and sat down. A different friend of mine happened to walk by me, put her hand on my shoulder and say “let the spirit move ok?”. Uncomfortable and guarded, but somehow expectant and open, I said hello to the two men and they started speaking to me. At this point, I already had a few little cute tears running down my checks but nothing crazy. Then one of them, off script, started speaking the truths of God to me. “You are loved, you are chosen, you are enough.” All things I had heard before but somehow it hit differently through this vessel. He continued on and on, not breaking eye-contact, and he looked at me, literally with  eyes that reflected the Father. His eyes shone with purity. I felt so safe. Then, he said the one thing that I never thought I would hear from a man. The one thing that combatted years of history and trauma. This man looked me dead in the eye, and said with a kind authority,
"You are not an object." </p>
                    <p> I broke. Instantly. No cute tears anymore, my face launched into my knees and I weeped. Everything in me tried to fight it, but God was uprooting lies, behaviors, and psychological trauma that had settled in for years. It wasn’t glamorous but it was deep and real and beautiful. I was trying to lift me head to say “thank you” or “sorry” or do anything at all, but I couldn’t. This man continued to speak truth over me, even though I couldn’t offer him anything. I said, this man continued to speak truth over me even though I couldn’t offer him anything. The basin was an event that allowed men to selflessly serve women who had probably never experienced that kind of “no strings-attached, brotherly love”. I know I hadn’t. I’ll always remember that night as an altar of healing in my life. I can genuinely say something broke off of me and it’s not coming back. Praise be to God, our deliverer and our healer!!  </p>
